# INFO
- This is a simple connection for the hlf network
- To use this we should either add the dns server or simply add the dns record to our hosts
- To make it easier we advise to simply add the following record in the `etc/hosts`
```
172.21.220.45 hlf-network
```
- We should add this because the certificates only work if you use the dns record from the network `hlf-network`
